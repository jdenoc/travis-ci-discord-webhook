# Travis CI 🡒 Discord Webhook

If you are looking for a way to get build (success/fail) status reports from
[Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com) in [Discord](https://discordapp.com), stop
looking. You've came to the right place.

I was waiting for the Travis team for a long time to integrate [Discord Webhook](https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks)
support to their build notifications, but they don't seem to be doing anything
about that. So I made these script to just do the same.

No need to wait for them to add Discord Webhook Integration, rest aside and
just follow the guide below and stay notified of your build status.

## Requirements
-  You should be using Travis CI for testing codes.
-  A Discord Server where notifications will be posted.
-  5 minutes
-  A cup of coffee ☕

## Guide
1.  Create a webhook in your Discord Server ([Guide](https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks)).

1.  Copy the **Webhook URL**.

1.  Go to your repository settings (for which you want status notifications)
    in Travis CI and add an environment variable called `WEBHOOK_URL` and paste
    the **Webhook URL** you got in the previous step.

1.  Add these lines to the `.travis.yml` file of your repository.

    ```yaml
    after_success:
      - wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jdenoc/travis-ci-discord-webhook/master/send.sh
      - chmod +x send.sh
      - ./send.sh success $WEBHOOK_URL
    after_failure:
      - wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jdenoc/travis-ci-discord-webhook/master/send.sh
      - chmod +x send.sh
      - ./send.sh failure $WEBHOOK_URL
    ```

## Guide - send images via webhook
1. Do the same as above until you're ready to add to the `.travis.yml` file.

1. Add these files to the `.travis.yml` file

  ```yaml
  after_failure:
    - wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jdenoc/travis-ci-discord-webhook/master/image-send.sh
	- chmod +x image-send.sh
	- ./image-send.sh $DUSK_SCREENSHOT_DIRECTORY $WEBHOOK_URL
  ```
